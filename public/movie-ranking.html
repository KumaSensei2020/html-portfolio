<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings Triology
</h3>
<p>This whole triology mastered multiple categories for me, from cinematography, graphics, music, acting, and special effects. They did a great job of evoking emotion on multiple levels in such a way that I was pulled into their world and left my own farbehind me.</p>
<h3>A Beautiful Mind</h3>
<p>Explores the brilliance of a mind that thinks so differently that it brings John Nash into the dark reaches of insanity while also allows him to climb the hieights of the capability of the human mind.</p>
<h3>Pirates of the Caribbean Franchise</h3> 
<p>Although the first, a usual, was the best, this whole series was fun and enchanting to watch as a family. The character of Jack Sparrow and that of his quirky rivals makes for a fun experience full of laughter, adventure, and intrigue.</p>
