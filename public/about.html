<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>My name is Amy Nielsen and I am a full time website and applications developer. I operate on a fully
  free lance basis, which means I am able to keep my rates affordable and within reason for you. I am just getting started 
  on this career path, having spent 14 years in the dental industry between administration, management, and multi-unit 
  operations mangement. The benefit for my clients in that experience is that I know what you are up against when
  setting out to market your business and make your services or products accessible, attractive, and convenient.
</p>

<p>I take pride in setting you up to look good! Your website is going to be, most of the time, any potential client
  or customer's FIRST impression of you! Just like you want any brick and mortar location to make your customer
  feel confident in your professionalism, your website has to meet that same standard AND THEN SOME. It has to get your potentials
  to walk through your door or pick up the phone. It has to call them to action!
</p>

<p>I provide a world-class level of understanding of your business and marketing needs and take pleasure
  in meeting challenges that force me to grow out of my comfort zone. So anything you throw at me, I am going to FIND A WAY FORWARD.
  Let's make your business grow together!
